# SubstanceOntology
Working project for designing substance model ideas

Focus is on testing ideas for improving the design of SNOMED CT substance hierarchy (and dependent structures).
Goal is to sufficiently define as much as possible, with limited complexity.

This project contains no SNOMED CT content, though does include entities that share similar names.
